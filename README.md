####

RNN_learn.py : learns from 'RawData.csv'

Please modify the 'data_path' string below to the directory where 'RawData.csv' is stored

Egs: data_path = '/Users/AllData/'

Saves the model parameters in the location (data_path + folder_name + '/')

where, 'folder_name' is determined in run-time. Its determination can be modified in the code

####



####

RNN_test.py : tests the model's performance on test data

Please modify the 'data_path' string below to the directory where 'RawData.csv' is stored

Egs: data_path = '/Users/AllData/'

Note: 'folder_name' string below should be the name of the folder (inside the 'data_path' folder) in which the parameters were exported in the learning phase
